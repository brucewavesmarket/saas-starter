/*
  Fix RLS Infinite Recursion in Team Members Table
  
  Purpose: Fix the infinite recursion issue in team_members policies
  The problem: policies were checking team_members table to determine access to team_members table
  
  Solution: Use direct user_id checks instead of subqueries that reference the same table
*/
